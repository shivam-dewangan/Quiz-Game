# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Quiz Fun Application

## Project Overview

The **Quiz Fun Application** is an interactive quiz platform built using **React**. It allows users to test their knowledge on various topics through multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The app features a **progress bar** to track quiz completion and displays a **result page** showing the score once the quiz is finished. The app fetches quiz questions dynamically using **Axios** from an external API.

### Key Features:

- **Multiple Quiz Themes**:
- **MCQ Questions**:
- **Progress Bar**:
- **Result Page**:
- **Axios for Data Fetching**:

## Tech Stack:

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to fetch quiz questions.
- **CSS**: For styling the app and creating an intuitive design.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites:

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime required to run the app.
- **npm** (Node Package Manager): To install project dependencies.

### Installation:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivam-dewangan/Quiz-Game.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the project**:

   ```bash
